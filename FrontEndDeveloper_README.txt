Files Written by Me:
--------------------
Frontend.java - A set of methods for printing the database's UI to the screen from the backend's organized data, allowing for extensive interaction with data and including systems for procedurally generating ASCII-art representations of bridges.
FrontEndDeveloperTests.java -A basic test suite confirming the core functionality of the program, due to the nuances in the UI the majority of testing was carried out manually.
ICBridges.csv - A data file for all currently-mapped bridges of the Illinois Central on its line between Dodgeville, WI and Red Oak, IL.  Written in collaboration with Joseph Peplinski.
CNWBridges.csv - A data file for all (or as many as possible) currently-mapped bridges of the Chicago & North Western on its line between Galena, IL and Montfort, WI.  Written in collaboration with Joseph Peplinski.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
Significant work in creation of the original proposal, helped other team members with ideas of how to approach method implementation, did original research for data sets and helped convert them into the form used in this program.
